# A-Symptom-based-Predictive-Model-to-Analyze-and-Detect-Heart-Attack
Heart attack is one of the most widely seen health issues in the world. Many people die because of this heart attack. Different symptoms and underlying causes are there for heart attack, which people do not generally know. Because of the fact, they ignore those symptoms like diabetes, chest pain, etc., that cause heart attack to those people. So, the understanding and identification of important symptoms are necessary to determine the heart attack. In this project, the symptom-based predictive model has been proposed through which the heart attack can be determined by emphasizing the symptoms. In this project, the classifiers from machine learning and deep learning have been chosen and applied to the heart attack dataset that has been collected from Kaggle. By applying all six classifiers, it has been observed that Convolutional Neural Network has produced 91.8% accuracy for predicting a heart attack, which is higher than the previous models. Therefore Convolutional Neural Network will be selected as the best classifier regarding the higher accuracy, f1-score, precision, and recall.
